Run it like this:

If you are in the base directory of the twisted-intro package,
you could run it like this:

  python twisted-client-4/get-poetry-stack.py 10001 10002 10003

to grab poetry from servers on ports 10001, 10002, and 10003.

But it's just going to print out a stacktrace as soon as it
gets the first poem.

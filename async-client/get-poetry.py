This is the Get Poetry Now! client, asynchronous edition.
Run it like this:

  python get-poetry.py port1 port2 port3 ...

If you are in the base directory of the twisted-intro package,
you could run it like this:

  python async-client/get-poetry.py 10001 10002 10003

to grab poetry from servers on ports 10001, 10002, and 10003.

Of course, there need to be servers listening on those ports
for that to work.
